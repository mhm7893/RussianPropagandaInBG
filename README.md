"# RussianPropagandaInBG" 

Even though Bulgaria is a member of the European Unition and NATO it one of the main “backdoors” in the Union and the Alliance. For years Putin is buying different medias: papers, TV channels and web sites to spread the Kremlin oriented agenda.

It is easy for him to spread that agenda as the older population is already infiltrated during the communist times of Bulgaria and USSR. 

In order to counter measure the web sites, we have to make an inventory. That is the sole purpose of this GitHub repository.

Please feel to add new web sites submitting new git request or send a e-mail with suggestion to mhm7893@yahoo.com.
